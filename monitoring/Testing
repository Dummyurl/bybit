At the moment, case 4 of iptcontrol seems half deficient: pings work, but regular websurfing does not work. Alternative rule, as in LAG, is:
iptables -A PREROUTING -i ap0 -m mac --mac-source !$MAC_ALWD -j DROP


Testing the hotspot:

# Client:
ping 217.70.184.38

# IISP, term 1
create_ap wlan0 wlan1 MyAccessPoint1

# IISP, term 2
./iptcontrol.sh 1
./iptcontrol.sh 2
./iptcontrol.sh 3
./iptcontrol.sh 4
./iptcontrol.sh 5

# IISP, term 1
# ctrl+C
iptables -F
create_ap wlan0 wlan1 MyAccessPoint1

# IISP, term 2 
control.sh 2000
