Current state of the project:

HOTSPOT:
Some bash files scripts (in /monitoring) enable to streamline iptables manipulation and (dis)allow or limitate a client's use of the hotspot. The bash scripts can take as an argument a number of bytes. In this case, a client is allowed to use the hotspot up to that level. 
Clients are identified by their MAC address.
The hotpost (DNS, DHCP etc.) is implemented using the create_ap project. Create_ap is fairly flexible. So far, I parametrized the hotspot to be NATED and open to all (no key). 

COMMUNICATION SERVER / CLIENT:
 
TRANSACTION SERVER: 
uses pybitcointools on both sides for now. 

ANDROID DEV: is in ByBit1. Very early stage.Please ignore it for now.
