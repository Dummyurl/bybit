Current state of the project is as follows:

Some bash files scripts (in /monitoring) enable to streamline iptables manipulation and (dis)allow or limitates client's use of the hotspot. The bash scripts can take as an argument a numbe rof bytes. In this case, a client is allowed to use the hotspot up to that level. 

Clients are identified by their MAC address.

The hotpost (DNS, DHCP etc.) is implemented using the create_ap project. Create_ap is fairly flexible. So far, I parametrized the hotspot to be NATED and open to all (no key). 

No transaction server has been yet created.
